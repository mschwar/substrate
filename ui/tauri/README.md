# Tauri App (Scaffold)

This is a minimal scaffold for the future Tauri UI. It is not yet buildable;
it only establishes the expected directory structure and placeholder files.

Planned:
- `src-tauri/` (Rust backend)
- `src/` (frontend UI)

Docs:
- `docs/UI_EDITOR_V0.md` for the editor mock behaviors.
- `docs/API_CONTRACT.md` for the Phase 1 API endpoints.
